    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m Felipe Oliveira, a Brazilian digital designer currently living and studying in Canada.
      I started my career in advertising and art direction, and today I’m focusing on UX and
      interactive experiences that connect people, brands, and stories.

      <h2>From São Paulo to Canada</h2>
      <p>
        For years I worked as an art director in Brazil, creating campaigns, digital content,
        and visual identities. Moving to Canada meant starting a new chapter and combining my
        experience in advertising with formal studies in Interactive Media Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This transition gave me a broader perspective on how people from different cultures use
        technology and how design can make those experiences more human and accessible.
