    <h1>Game Journal</h1>
    <p>
      Games are more than a hobby for me—they’re a lab for understanding systems,
      interfaces, and player behavior. Here I connect what I play with how I design.

      <h2>Project Zomboid</h2>
      <p>
        Project Zomboid looks simple at first, but its systems are deep and unforgiving.
        It taught me a lot about information overload, tooltips, and how small interface
        decisions can mean the difference between survival and frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pay attention to how the game surfaces critical information—like health,
        moodles, and inventory—and how that can inspire cleaner, more honest interfaces
        in real products.

      <h2>Riot Games</h2>
      <p>
        In competitive games, clarity is everything. Cooldowns, skill ranges, and
        feedback must be readable in a fraction of a second. Riot’s approach is a
        masterclass in visual language, iconography, and motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring these lessons into UX: users shouldn’t have to “fight” the interface to
        understand what’s happening or what their options are.
