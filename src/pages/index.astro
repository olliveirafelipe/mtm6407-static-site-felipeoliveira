      <h2>Product & UX Design</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been working in design for over a decade, from ad campaigns and digital out-of-home
        to web design and UX. Today, I focus on interfaces and experiences that are inclusive,
        accessible, and visually compelling.

      <h2>Games as a Design Lab</h2>
      <p>
        From competitive worlds to survival games like Project Zomboid, I study how game mechanics,
        UI, and feedback loops keep people engaged—and I bring those learnings back into my design work.
